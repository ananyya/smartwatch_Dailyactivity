# smartwatch_Dailyactivity
There is a lot of competition among the brands in the smartwatch industry. Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare. 
The dataset I am using for Smartwatch data analysis is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset was initially collected from 30 female users of the Fitbit smartwatch.I have uploaded the data set as well.
This is a learning project so feel free to drop in your valuable comments/suggestions/corrections.
